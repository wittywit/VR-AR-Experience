#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- tech like project Soli is designed to hand track specific movements.

- imagine pressing your thumb and index together, with the index finger being the actual button (this allows user to feel force of button)

- add 2d visual cues like a hand print with a palm-up below an object for the user to recognize that the object should be picked up

- data visualization will allow us to have data represented by objects: think of a data that represents 100 people, now you can see those 100 people in digital form

- UI/UX designers will need to work with 3d modelers to deliver data in unique ways
