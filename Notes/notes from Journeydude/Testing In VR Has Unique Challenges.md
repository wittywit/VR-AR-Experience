#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- The biggest portion of VR testing attempts to account for user comfort and minimization of simulator sickness alongside traditional QA procedures

- Many situations in VR such as moving/tilting horizons, high density fast moving textures or materials, exponential speed scaling and so on can be disorienting to users both familiar and unfamiliar to VR experiences

- head bobbing, a classic design behavior in games do not translate to VR as extra movement exaggerated to the user causing sever simulator sickness
