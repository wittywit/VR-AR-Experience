#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- gateways are becoming a common method of transitioning users from one scene to the next

- When you walk through a doorway, it serves as a trigger for the mind to file memories away.

- When you walk through a doorway, be it real or simulated, the act serves as a trigger for the mind to file memories away, freeing up space for us to process the new environment we're in.

- The human brain holds onto a limited model of the world that stays active in our awareness, relying on the fact that we can always check in with reality if we need a quick update.

- But if the environment changes, or if we move to a new environment say, through a doorway, then we may lose information that we really only built in broad strokes inside our heads and subsequently fail to notice changes in the environment.

- We can also make educated choices about what features or events to keep in the same "room" so we don't fight against the user's brain wanting to wipe the working memory slate clean if we have them traverse through a gateway in the middle of a mentally-taxing activity.

- this type of mental state change can also be used against the user's brain: a mechanic that centers around changing details of the environment when you're not paying attention to them, like the VR experience Sightline uses, forcing the user to pay attention to what they would otherwise miss and put even more pressure on their working memory.

- It can also be used to create a powerful sense of dread/uneasiness, like we saw in the Silent Hill PT demo, since the world around us is behaving in an unexpected way. We could also use a strategically-placed gateway to help the user take a cognitive load off and mentally prepare for the next experience or task.
