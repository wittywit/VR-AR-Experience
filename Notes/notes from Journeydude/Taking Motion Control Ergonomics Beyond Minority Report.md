#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- reported that during minority report tom cruise had to rest his arms when using the AR device (called gorilla arms)

- our goal should always be to empower the user, and not make them feel tired or inadequate

- the problem with minority report interface is that:
    - it forces users to wave their hands and arms around

    - at shoulder level

    - for extended periods of time

- There are situations where large-scale, broad gesture gestural interfaces make sense: gaming, collaboration situations, public installations, possibly industrial settings. In general: activities that are short-term in duration.

- thus, brief interactions are much easier

- its important to allow the user to rest their hands and an app should elegantly handle that. for example if you make a fist and withdraw your hand, then the controls aren’t impacted

- some airspace apps pause the game automatically when no hands are detected

- it’s good to keep your elbows near the torso and your shoulders relaxed, as in sketches below. Design your app with this posture in mind.

- some hand poses are much easier than other

- we’ve found that new Leap Motion users often get so excited that they elevate their entire arm in non-ergonomic ways.

- to prevent users from over exerting themselves
    - remind new users to keep their elbows at their sides

    - tweak the angles when you program with hand variables, so that the most ideal hand positions work with lowered elbows

    - assuming your app is for desktop users, pick a comfortable interaction height that can be reached with the elbow down.

- always keep your user’s comfort in mind.

- if interactions required often, consider frequency of use and make interactions ridiculously fast and easy to access.
