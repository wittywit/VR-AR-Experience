#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- don’t want a lot of small texts and graphs

- we’re humans, can use instincts for UI purposes

- real life is a 3d interface

- more screen space makes computer workers more productive

- space cognition helps

- vr allows users to customize work space

- we had content, applications, organization and metadata, symbols + icons (with text descriptions), feedback from cursors, sound, and image change are all found in current OS environment

- our GUI for VR
    - laser pointer cursor (its a bit shaky though so they make the rand wider as the laser increases in distance

    - crosshairs are another option.

    - intersecting lense idea (more research needed)

    - world in mini next to you, moving the items in the mini world change the world around you. you can also
    move yourself and change your location

    - teleportation

    - cursor menu and space

    - radio menu associated with hands or other bodies

    - switch tools or modify cursor actions with buttons or gestures

- how do all of these work in VR?

- hardware will change UI over time

- in chair
    - field of view around 94 degrees

    - rotate head comfortably with 30 degrees and semi comfortable 55 degrees

    - up and down comfortable and max for moving up and down

- 15 - 50 degrees downward from head if looking at a screen (best ergonomics) and outside strain zone

- because of how eyes can’t see further than certain meters away stereoscopically, you can make items flat and possibly on the sky box.

- showing text should be at minimum 1.3 meters away from head

- within context(safe zone) show content

- anything touchable should be 2/3 arm stretch away

- you can put stuff around your hands permitting hardware

- buttons let you cause an action

- because finger move through button, it seems odd, or does it?

- think of how finger can go through water (we are using human environment here)

- we thus use colors in real world to detect states of something, loading equals yellow(yellow being fire since you tend to sit and wait near a fire)

- you condense things to collections, instead of a stack of plates, you have one plate you can keep replicating itself as soon as you pick it up

- you need a design workflow for mockups: foreground, mid ground, and background. each section has specific things for each zone
