#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- Never stop tracking the user’s head position inside of the application. Even a short pause in head tracking will cause some users to feel ill. This principle, along with “using constant velocity at low speeds”, or “grounding the user in their environment” are all guidelines needed for any basic VR experience.

- It's not wise to start out immediately at a constant velocity. Google standards are “ experimenting with 83 milliseconds of acceleration, about 3m/s of constant velocity, and 266 milliseconds of deceleration.”

- Until we have eye tracking, reticles might be next best thing.
    - Make sure it doesn't interfere with the design of the application.
    - The goal of the reticle is to easily allow users to understand if something is selectable, to quickly navigate through a menu, etc.

- The impact of differences in scale between the user and their environment is important. Use scale.

- Spatial audio places sounds in physical locations in the environment around you. Use it to guide the user, show them whats around, etc.

- A gaze cue is when the experience reacts based on where the user is looking. The experience could react more subtly, “hover state” style, or it could be event-based, like spawning a monster behind you in a horror game.

- As in all things, make it beautiful.
