#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- Virtual reality is a new paradigm.

- A main driving behind the evolution of consumer technologies across history has been our desire for more an more efficient means of information transfer. In other words: I have a thought or idea in my brain, and i need a way to share that same thought or idea in your brain

- The language of the new VR paradigm, however, will no longer be about screen resolutions and dimensions and pixels. The language of VR will use words like: experience. presence. feeling. mood. energy. immersion.

- The evolution of these technologies can be seen as stories of going from a lower-resolution means of communicating an idea to a higher-resolution means of communication.

- My following predictions are based on current VR news and the assumption that the persistent need for higher-resolution communication and the desire of easier means of bringing people together will remain driving forces in the evolution of the new technology just as they have to past technologies.

- Predictions:
    - Console gamers and PC gamers will lead the way in discovering the best types of VR experiences, the most effective VR menu/UIs, essentially discovering the ‘language’ of VR I mentioned above. Innovations in gaming will begin to make their way to non-gaming VR applications, and this trend will remain for the coming few years.
    - By the end of 2016 every social VR platform will have avatars that show head movement, and hands that can be fully articulated with controllers (gloves, Oculus touch, Leap Motion etc). (I suspect that intricate hand movements will still need some work)
    - By the end of 2016 there will be software beginning to explore controlling avatar mouth movement by speech detection and expression-detection either through a motion capture of the user’s face and/or with speech tone-recognition (Apple now owns Faceshift technology and patents.)

    - Issues like black smudge (if you shift your head, the object changes position in the hmd but ends up with a black smudge appearing on screen as the object slides across the screen) or the screen door effect(the visible screen-door-like black mesh caused by the gaps between pixels) will disappear by 2018.
