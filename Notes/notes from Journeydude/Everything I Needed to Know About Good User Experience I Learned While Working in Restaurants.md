#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- Aesthetics affect enjoyment and the perception of value and quality.

- Atmosphere and presentation can make or break the experience.

- Prioritize rather than showing huge photos of everything. Recognition is better than recall, and images are easier to recognize than words.

- Focus on what you do best, and limit choices to make deciding easier.

- Don't rush people who want to take their time, and don’t slow down those who are in a hurry.

- Set expectations correctly for timing.

- Anticipate customer needs whenever possible. Providing something before people realize they need it delights them. That's where the biggest gains can come from.

- Process and task efficiency make or break both profitability and customer satisfaction.

- Assign responsibility clearly so that issues can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily. keep a system doing one thing, the less the communication between systems from a UI standpoint, the better

- Make suggestions that increase customer enjoyment as well as sales. Would you like batteries with that? Of course you would. People who bought this also bought a container to put it in. Here are some in the right size.

- Tune your language and interaction style to your customer.

- The customer owns the space. don’t change things users customized. keep it customized.

- Reduce clutter as much as possible without hiding needed tools or disrupting work in progress.

- a customer who gets effective help in a crisis often provides the best endorsements.

- When things go wrong, apologize. Even if it isn't your fault, be sorry that something bad happened. Admit that an error occurred that should not have, commit to helping fix the problem, and follow through.

- Have policies, but bend them sometimes in order to keep customers happy.

- Don't be quick to assume anything based on customer appearance or demographics, because assumptions offend, and people tend not to be WYSIWYG.

- Orient new customers by recommending top sellers.

- People avoid clicking on unknown items and often just ignore what they don't understand. Avoid bad naming. When you must, use workarounds for bad navigation labels. Use customer’s vocabulary

- Explain terms that may be new to your users without any hint of condescension.

- Delight new customers by giving away free samples.

- If you can’t provide what users need, try to steer them in the right direction and help them as much as possible

- If people want to buy something you sell, don’t make them join something or tell you about their personal preferences first. Remove everything that gets in the way of a fast, smooth transaction.

- Your best customers do your best marketing. Recognize repeat customers. Remember what they prefer.

- Don't make frequent visitors slog through first-time–visitor rituals and orientation. Ask them if they already know what they want.

-  Never embarrass or be rude to a host customer if they are relatively well behaved. Instead, support their need to be recognized and useful.

- Don’t punish those who have invested the time to learn your UI by changing everything at once.

- When change must occur, retain the features most valued by customers.

- When prices go up or value goes down, many customers just leave. Don’t increase the effort of staying, make it the easiest thing to do. Avoid the false economy of cutting quality and disappointing your loyal supporters.

- Make sure important or frequent customer feedback gets to top management. Customers and VIPs are your best allies when changes need to be made.

- Good user experience is much more than task completion, efficiency, and error reduction. It requires creating customer delight and meeting expectations consistently in a comfortable setting.
