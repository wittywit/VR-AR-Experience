#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- if the optics software was designed to expect you to have four limbs clearly visible, or to be standing, your user experience sucks.

- Present-day optics do a bad job of detecting where you're located or what your limbs are doing if you don't match what the software expects your body to look like.

- One of the obvious ways the user is limited in this way would be like how eye tracking isn't even really a thing (yet), but also how certain actions like anything to do with finger gestures or moving your feet won't be possible inputs.

- in essence, we have two challenges here:

    - people who are are fully or mostly able-bodied in real life won’t have full-body functionality in VR due to hardware limitations

    - people who have some kind of physical limitation in real life will struggle with assumptions that the user is able-bodies, to the point where certain VR experiences are impossible (i think it also breaks the possibility of immersion, unless the user is wanting to experience an able-bodied one)

- if we accommodate for the first challenge then that will help ppl who are impacted by #2. everyone is limited in the VR world due to real-space restrictions

- the lighthouse system works well for accessibility because no assumption being made about completeness or orientation of users body

- when we move away from sitting VR experience to standing VR experience, we make assumptions that the user is capable of doing such things

- (my own thought, in the future will video games have a rating based on physical level??)

- Players who have trouble making use of VR controllers can be offered the option to use gaze as an alternative UI to interact with the environment.

- developers can use things like settings for a seated experience or alternate means of movement for ppl who can’t do so

- you can replace a controller with a gaze focus

- Almost 33% of adults in the U.S. have at least one basic action difficulty or complex activity limitation.

- interaction designs should be evaluated for any experiences that require uncomfortable or even impossible interactions from users

- By defining user input and interface limitations on both the hardware side and the human side, we can better tailor VR experiences to specific degrees of physical demands and limitations for everyone, and also offer accessibility settings similar to a more real-life type of "difficulty" setting that matches the VR interactions and UI to the capabilities of the end user.
