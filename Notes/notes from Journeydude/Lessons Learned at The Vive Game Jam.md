#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- 15x15 foot is standard VR standards

- have a safe zone to ensure users don’t go too far away from non tracking zone

- keep dynamic lighting off for unity resulted in great frame rates

- keep in mind the boundary

- with 1 to 1 tracking, ppl automatically get it

- walking around a space, no one is worried. walking is natural

- in VR with moving items, ppl don’t care about throwing dynamics

- don’t gamify VR, it’s natural to human environment

- when you have a character in VR and know the depth, you can connect with that character because you feel like its there with you

- being able to walk around and have the characters interact with you

- you can do tricks to have the user think they are in bigger areas such as a lift. close the door, keep frame of
reference of static, then have doors open to show new area (need to research this more? maybe not).

- any movement that you didn’t cause is jarring to the user. in other words, let the user have absolute control over the experience.

- don’t expect players to commit an action that they aren’t capable of feeling in the real world, if the floor is flat but in VR they are climbing stairs or a steep hill, the immersion is broken.

- constant engagement, seeing new elements, are all things that improve user experience

- social environments with VR like mario party style gaming can be rewarding

- you have to understand the user will not always start the game in the same position, and the app should expect that change and adjust accordingly

- turn off rigid position and gravity for player camera

- the VR environment should match the real world

- ppl can go through walls but ppl will respect boundaries, etc.

- if there is a wall, ppl respect it and think its intuitive
