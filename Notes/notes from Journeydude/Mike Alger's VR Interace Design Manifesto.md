#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- what will the OS system look like in VR?
    - 15 years before OS is great

- tools that we know inherently how to use such as a straw or hammer can be used to define the best UI experience in VR

- within graphic design, ppl use things like size, color, movement contrast helps to focus the user on one specific item

- motion design is set to let the user know what they should do

- again, with VR we must introduce new ways for the user to interact and have it as intuitive as possible

- theres some new thins we can try
    - contract/motion cues

    - homophonic notification sounds

    - pointing

    - viewports

    - shadows

    - day & night cycles

    - weather

    - interpersonal UI icons
        - folded arms, eye contact, etc.

- VR screen is around you

- your windows donâ€™t have to be rectangle, but something else

- environment design, what architects and interior designers already know, are things VR designers need to learn

- things like the browser toolbar will change in VR.

- a keyboard is a crutch, maybe virtual keyboard or other technique like palm pilot text gesture is better option

- still need backwards compatibility for 2d design
