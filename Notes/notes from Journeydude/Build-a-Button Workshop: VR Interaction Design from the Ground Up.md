#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- every item in the VR/AR world should be reactive

- users don’t know what to expect and having things reactive helps build a mental model of how the virtual world works

- design your buttons to have clear passive, transitional, and active states
    - dormant: UI shouldn’t feel obstructive or clutter the scenery. Arm HUD menu system disappears when your palm is facing away. in this state, it’s like a giant wristwatch

    - passive: flipping your arm over and three buttons appear. they’re distinctly colored and have text-based OFF cues, so its instantly apparent.

    - transitional: when user touches the button, it responds by being pushed down slightly in Z-space. even if the button isn’t fully pushed or activated, user will still feel like button is being touched

    - active: once button pressed and reached invisible anchor plane, it will be activated. once activated, changes color, the OFF text changes to ON, and rebounds to its original position.

- recommend that a single finger target should be no smaller than 20 mm in real-world size.

- to help with button interactions, can also space buttons apart, momentarily lock nearby buttons when a button is pressed, make a hand semi-transparent when approaches a button, or make only one part of the hand able to interact with UI

- buttons should exist within goldilocks zone (between desk height and eye level)

- be careful about putting interactive elements at desk height or below, leap motion has a hard time tracking items

- avoid above eye level, can cause neck strain and gorilla arm.
