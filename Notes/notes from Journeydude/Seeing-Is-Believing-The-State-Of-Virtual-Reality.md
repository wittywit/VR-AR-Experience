#### Notes from thejourneydude:

- Born of technology, virtual reality at its core is an organic experience.

- VR at its best shouldn’t replace real life, but modify it. It should give us access to so much just out of reach physically and economically. If you can dream it, VR can make it. It’s a medium for progress, not progress itself.

- On users viewing a monitor recording themselves from behind live: When I would move the cursor to start drawing on them, they would treat the cursor like it was a living thing: they would hide from it, or try to hit it away. So then I made the cursor into a ball and put the ball on the screen. I had them playing virtual volleyball with a nonexistent ball without saying a word to them. What struck me was that people just accepted this. They had never read about anything like this. They had never thought about this. It was as if in their DNA, they’d been waiting for this moment and knew exactly what to do.

- I believed that if you made the interface centered on the hand, it reinforced a way of approaching the world in terms of doing things to things as an instrument — either shooting it or manipulating it in some way. So we introduced a hands-free interface that relied on breathing and balance. This shifted the experience from one of "doing" to one of "being".

- During an interview: Do you think it could also replace how we use the basic internet? Ondrejka: [It’s not clear if] the right way to represent the web is some very literal spatial model. That’s where things get more complicated because the web is so vast that spatial models tend to break down. You can’t put enough things close to you if you’re trying to do a truly spatial model. You don’t want text floating in space in random orientations — you want it where you’d hold a book. There are limitations in how we’d consume 2D content in 3D.

- We are evolved to operate in 3D spaces. You can name and locate 1,000 things scattered around an apartment, but you can’t remember the file structure on your computer or the files on your desktop. We are very good at remembering spatial environments. VR has the advantage of being able to plug into that.

- The challenge there is that while those imagined interfaces tend to be exciting visually, they are built to be entertaining, they’re not built to be useful. No one’s had to live with a sci-fi interface for eight hours a day at their desk.

- Jaron Lanier:  I think there are a lot of other gaming platforms where you see that sort of thing emerging. There’s a bit of an unfortunate thing that happens in the gaming world — which is a mirror of what happens in the cinema world — where the very biggest budgets and promotions are reserved for what’s perceived as the most conservative bets, which are inevitably these macho destruction fantasies. I suspect that those decisions are actually not the optimal ones from the business point of view; that if people had the courage to tunnel through and try to do more things like Minecraft, they would actually make more money than with more shoot-’em-up things.

- Jaron Lanier: But I would say it’s not going with the intensity of something like Minecraft. Minecraft has proven some sort of longevity. Second Life, for a brief moment, was probably as big as Oculus or VPL in terms of public attention. It didn’t sustain that. Another thing with Second Life — I don’t think it was extensible enough. There was this problem that a lot of this stuff started to look the same because the tools didn’t have that much breadth. And that was a big issue.

- Kevin Kelly: I think it’s a scalable thing. It’s centralized in a certain sense. With Minecraft, everybody can put it up on their own server and that really helped spread it so you can have a little bit more decentralized, scalable input.

- Jaron Lanier: There are about four major variations on VR: one where you’re all in there, which is like Oculus; a heads-up thing, which would be like Google Glass; another would be mixed reality where you see stuff overlaid and mixed in with the real world; another would be telepresence where you feel that you’ve embodied some device; and another is tele-immersion, where you might [be] in a remote location but with sufficient illusion that it transcends video conferencing.

- Jaron Lanier:  The best way to use VR, not in some moralistic or judgmental sense, but just in terms of my experience, is [to] use it as little as possible and enjoy the contrast that it gives me to reality
